### Zen of Python 

- See http://wiki.python.org.tw/The%20Zen%20Of%20Python

- Beautiful is better than ugly.

- Explicit is better than implicit.

- Simple is better than complex.

- Complex is better than complicated.

- Flat is better than nested.

- Sparse is better than dense.

- Readability counts.

- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

- Although practicality beats purity.

- Errors should never pass silently.

- Unless explicitly silenced.

- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

- Now is better than never.

- Although never is often better than *right* now.

- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

- 美麗優於醜陋，明講好過暗諭。

- 簡潔者為上，複雜者次之，繁澀者為下。

- 平舖善於層疊，勻散勝過稠密；以致輕鬆易讀。

- 特例難免但不可打破原則，務求純淨卻不可不切實際。

- 斷勿使錯誤靜靜流逝，除非有意如此。

- 在模擬兩可之間，拒絕猜測的誘惑。

- 總會有一種明確的寫法，最好也只有一種，

- 但或須細想方可得。

- 凡事雖應三思後行，但坐而言不如起而行。

- 難以解釋的實作方式，必定是壞方法。

- 容易解釋的實作方式，可能是好主意。

- 命名空間讚，吾人多實用。
